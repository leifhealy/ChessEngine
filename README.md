# ChessEngine
Friendly chess AI competition between two work collegues. The goal is to each write a chess engine and then set them off 
in a compitition to see whose one wins the most games. 

I am currently working on the ChessGame class which will handle the state of the board, moving pieces, displaying the board,
and checking for illegal moves. Once this is done Leif and Dirk can each write there own engine in leif.py and dirk.py respectively. This can be done in different git branches to keep the stategies hidden. Then we can merge them together and 
see whose engine wins the most games.
